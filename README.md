# narratr
## now with fewer vowels

**Note**: I changed the repo name so you guys may have to do `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/cswatt/narratr.git`

## running tests
Let's use nose!
`pip install nose`

And then just run `nosetests`

If you wanna see how an ntr file is lexed/parsed/etc., here's a tool:
`python examine.py whatever.ntr`

Add a `-v` for verbose.
